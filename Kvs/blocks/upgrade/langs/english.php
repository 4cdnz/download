	KVS supports paid registrations via web billings (Credit Card billings, Paypal and etc). Additionally you can
	pre-generate access codes in [kt|b]User accounts generator[/kt|b] plugin and sell them using alternate channels,
	such as various digital markets, or provide free of charge to promote your paid content. You can also use this
	plugin to create the actual accounts and sell them, but this will mean that users will have to use the provided
	username / password pairs instead of signing up with their own data.
	[kt|br][kt|br]

	Parameters in paid access section are designed to control which payment methods should be enabled. Enabling web
	payment method requires you to have at least one active billing in [kt|b]Memberzone[/kt|b] section of KVS admin
	panel. Using access codes requires you to have some access codes pre-generated via
	[kt|b]User accounts generator[/kt|b] plugin and then distributed among users, so that they can use access codes
	and upgrade their profiles.
