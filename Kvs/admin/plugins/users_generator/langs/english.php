		This plugin will generate the desired amount of user accounts with random usernames / passwords or access codes
		that can be used to upgrade accounts to premium status or get some tokens. You can use it to sell pre-generated
		accounts / access codes in digital stores as an alternative to using payment processors.
		[kt|br][kt|br]
		Access codes allow existing users to upgrade their existing (own) accounts to premium status or get some
		tokens once per each access code. They also allow new users to specify a code during signup and get benefit of
		the specified access code. An existing user can use multiple access codes if they give tokens - in this case
		tokens from all codes will be added to the user's balance. When using access code that upgrades account to
		premium status, user won't be allowed to use another access code while the user's account is premium. User will
		be able to use another access code only after their status is changed back to normal.
