		The avatar-generating plugin creates avatars for categories based on videos or albums in these categories. For
		each category, only one video / album is selected, and the main image of this video / album (more specifically,
		its source file) will be used as the avatar for this category. In plugin settings, you can choose
		the sorting method used to choose a category`s main video / album. You also need to specify the ImageMagick
		options string that will be used to resize source files to the avatar size.
