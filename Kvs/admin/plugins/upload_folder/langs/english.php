		This plugin can make uploading video and photo content to your servers much easier. All you need to do is
		upload the files to the server with the required file structure and run the plugin, modifying its settings so
		that it processes the right directories. The plugin will analyze the directories and give you an overview of
		the content found there. During the final launch the selected content will be added to the site.
		[kt|br][kt|br]
		The plugin supports 2 directories for uploading videos and albums. We recommend using the same directories each 
		time as content duplicates are detected based on directories (i.e. when content that has already been added and 
		wasn`t deleted is uploaded to the same directory, it is considered duplicate). For security reasons, the 
		directories with uploaded files need to be child directories of the root directory of your site.
		[kt|br][kt|br]
		Both video directories let you upload single video files to directory root and multiple files into
		subdirectories as well. Subdirectories can contain video files, video description in TXT file, screenshots in
		ZIP archives or as JPG files. You can upload not just video source files but files of individual formats as
		well. When needed, you can upload only source files, or only format files, or any combination of these.
		[kt|br][kt|br]
		Similarly to videos, you can upload photo album files either file by file to directory root, or upload
		subdirectories with multiple files in them. The photos can be uploaded as ZIP archives, or as sets of JPG
		images. Album description in TXT file.
		[kt|br][kt|br]
		After the plugin completes the upload, the uploaded files will not be deleted. You can either keep them
		or delete them manually. When you run the plugin again, files or subdirectories that have already been uploaded
		will be considered duplicate.
